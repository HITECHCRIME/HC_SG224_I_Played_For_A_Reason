## Lyrics

```
Such Wicked times, we gotta fight
We gotta fight 

i played for a reason, it's twofold
crashing through the twisted rot
got a couple friends in darkness
of the draught

tried my fingers on the truth 
it's a draught - when (as) I lay my fingers on the truth
tough to count them on the floor they fell off

i know maybe touched it a bit too hard 
drop to the floor 
ground is way too dull
making fools of the dues
now it's all a ruse

```
